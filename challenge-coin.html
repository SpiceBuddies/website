							<h2>What is a challenge coin, how did it start, and why a duck?</h2>
							<p>
								To learn the fully history behind a challenge coin, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
								To summarize, challenge coins started as a military tradition for service members when they join a unit to 
								represent them being a part of that team.  Anyone with a coin can challenge those around them to show their 
								coin.  Should someone not have a coin for the challenge, then they need purchase a drink for everyone who 
								does have a coin.<br /><br />
								
								Why do the SpiceBuddies have a coin?  Besides a few buddies being the life of the party in the after-hours 
								events, it started from the 
								<a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/people/jimmy-t/projects/spiceworks-challenge-coin" target="_blank">unofficial Spiceworks challenge coin</a> 
								created by Jimmy T.  It started as a fan 
								project for Spiceheads and Spiceworkers to show we're all apart of the Spiceworks community.  This 
								created a lot of interest for more coins and different design.  Since Jimmy T. was part of the SpiceBuddies 
								when the first coin was created, a design was created for the 2019 SpiceWorld.<br /><br />
								
								Why a duck?  It all started when Spiceworks revealed their new logo in 2017.  Huw3481 thought the logo was 
								in the shape of a duck and posted <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/blog/2645-an-exciting-day-here-at-spiceworks?page=1#39520" target="_blank">this gif</a>.
								Spiceworks never confirmed or denied the existing of the hidden duck in the logo.  Since Spiceworks already 
								has SpiceRex as their mascot, the SpiceBuddies offered a home to this duck with the name SpiceDuck!  To see 
								more hijinks this humble duck has brought, <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2265457-spiceduck-is-spreading" target="_blank">check</a>

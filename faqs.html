							<h1>SpiceBuddies FAQ - 2025 Edition</h1>
							<details>
								<summary>General Questions</summary>
								<p><strong>What the heck is a SpiceBuddy?</strong></p>
								<p>The SpiceBuddies are SpiceHeads just like you! We're a group of veteran SpiceWorld attendees who are super passionate about helping their fellow IT pros get the most out of the conference both on a professional level and a personal level.</p>
						
								<p><strong>I'm a vendor… am I welcome at SpiceBuddy events?</strong></p>
								<p>Absolutely! The vendors that pay for booths help make sure that the conference happens every year and the vendors that sponsor events make the conference a ton more fun for all attendees! Our one rule is that while you're with The SpiceBuddies you're a person; not a salesperson.</p>
						
								<p><strong>I'm feeling super overwhelmed...where do I start??</strong></p>
								<p>Attending a conference for the first time can be nerve-wracking especially if you've never been to one before or just feel uncomfortable in big groups of strangers. A SpiceBuddy is a friendly face you can look for in the sea of strangers.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>Travel Questions</summary>
								<p><strong>I'm arriving early for (or leaving late after) the conference; what other stuff can I explore in the area?</strong></p>
								<p>The SpiceBuddies put together an Austin map which labels restaurants, bars, hangouts, and other awesome stuff to do while in Austin.</p>
						
								<p><strong>When should I arrive in Austin? How about leaving?</strong></p>
								<p>While Wednesday is the official first day of SpiceWorld.  However, Tuesday is the unofficial start! You may be attending the paid PowerShell or Microsoft sessions and you won't want to miss the <b>SpiceBuddies Boot Camp</b> at noon.</p>
						
								<p><strong>How do I get downtown from the airport?</strong></p>
								<p>The most direct way is to take a taxi or use a ridesharing app though this is a bit more expensive. The Capital Metro bus system is a cheap option at $1.25 for a single ride.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>The hotels are so expensive!</summary>
								<p>If you want to stay in a hotel, keep an eye on the SpiceWorld travel page. Every year Spiceworks organizes blocks of rooms at a bunch of hotels in the area so it's a bit cheaper to book as part of the hotel block than separately.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>What's Central Machine Works?</summary>
								<p>Central Machine Works is the location of the SpiceWorld party Thursday night. Shuttles will start ferrying people to Central Machine Works after the Final Hurrahs on Thursday.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>How do I get around in Austin?</summary>
								<p>For most stuff, your feet will do you just fine; many (if not most) events are within easy walking distance of the conference center. For everything else, the bus system is pretty good.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>I'm arriving hours before I can check into my hotel/Airbnb...what do I do with my stuff?</summary>
								<p>The Austin Visitor Center has a Suitcase Stash program noted on their website. "If space allows, the Visitor Center will hold your luggage for $8 per piece per day freeing you to explore Austin unencumbered."</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>SpiceWorld Advice & Info</summary>
								<p><strong>What should I pack?</strong></p>
								<p>As little as possible to make more room for swag! Pack enough shirts to get you through the Welcome Shindig and you'll collect more than enough shirts to get you through the rest of the conference.</p>
						
								<p><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>
								<p>As long as all your naughty bits are covered, no one cares. Almost everyone will be in vendor shirts and jeans/shorts/leggings/kilts. (There's a special Kilt badge you get on your profile for wearing a kilt to SpiceWorld.)</p>
						
								<p><strong>Should I bring my laptop?</strong></p>
								<p>As always, this depends on you, your note-taking preference, how much support you have back at work, and the distance to your hotel room. You may be better off taking the pen and paper, smartphone, or tablet route for taking notes.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>What sort of things should I expect from events?</summary>
								<p>The events are as plentiful and varied as the many vendors, Spiceworkers, The SpiceBuddies, and SpiceHeads that make this conference what it is.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>Should I make a schedule of things I want to do or just wing it?</summary>
								<p>A bit of both works out really well. It's great to have a schedule of things that you want to do/see throughout the conference.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>What's this I hear about swag?</summary>
								<p>You will get lots of swag from all the vendors and Spiceworks! Backpacks, bottles, pens, toys, stickers, t-shirts, polo shirts, socks, sunglasses, and more!</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>What's the Passport to Prizes?</summary>
								<p>Passport to prizes is a booklet with a grid of all the vendors that are sponsoring an item in the raffle during the Final Hurrahs. You have to visit each vendor booth to get their stamp.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>What are the sessions?</summary>
								<p>Sessions are presentations put on by SpiceHeads, vendors, and special guests on a topic of their expertise. There are panels on various topics, listed in the official agenda and the SpiceWorld app.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>I don't want to miss any of the sessions! What can I do about two sessions I want to see at the same time?</summary>
								<p>Some popular sessions may be repeated on the second day. Some sessions will be recorded for post-conference viewing. Major stuff should be streamed, depending on the contract with the speaker.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>I'm not sure I can handle so many people!</summary>
								<p>SpiceWorld is what you make it. If you're just there for the sessions and the vendor hall, you're good. But if you're a SpiceHead, everyone at this conference is one of your people.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>I'm a major introvert. I need survival tips!</summary>
								<p>A lot of IT Pros are introverts and probably a great deal of The SpiceBuddies as well! Get to know your fellow SpiceHeads! Reach out to someone online or over chat before meeting them face-to-face.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>How bad are vendor follow-ups going to be after the conference?</summary>
								<p>If you do the Passport to Prizes and visit all the vendors, then you can definitely expect some vendors to be reaching out. Remember: the vendors are why we get SpiceWorld.</p>
							</details>
						
							<details>
								<summary>Top SpiceBuddies Advice for Surviving SpiceWorld</summary>
								<p>Attend our bootcamp sessions! This is a fantastic way to meet some friendly faces and get tips about SpiceWorld, Spiceworks, SpiceCorps, and other things.</p>
						
								<p>Dress comfy! Comfortable shoes are a must. Make sure to hydrate and take care of yourself so you can enjoy the whole conference. You'll get tons of swag!</p>

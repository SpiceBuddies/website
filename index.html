							<h2>All About the SpiceBuddies</h2>
							<p>
								The SpiceBuddy program was started for SpiceWorld 2016 by SpiceWorld veterans in an effort to help new 
								attendees make the most of the SpiceWorld conference experience.  It's not easy going to a tech conference 
								for the first time. If this is your first SpiceWorld we have your back!  Our goal is to be those faces in a sea 
								of strangers you can depend on for answers.  Let us help educate you about all that you can experience at 
								the conference.  Whether you came to hear a specific session, to meet with vendors, or to network with your 
								peers, we are here to help you make the most of SpiceWorld!<br /><br/>
								This website aggregates the official, semi-official, and unofficial parties, get-togethers, mixers, 
								hangouts, and shindigs, so that you have all the info you need to make the most of SpiceWorld right at 
								your fingertips!  Below you'll find a map of every location that is playing to a get-together - whether 
								official or unofficial - as well as many other useful places in the area.

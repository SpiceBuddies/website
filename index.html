							<h2>All About the SpiceBuddies</h2>
							<p>
								The SpiceBuddy program was started for SpiceWorld 2016 by SpiceWorld veterans an effort to help new 
								attendees make the most of the SpiceWorld conference experience.  It's not easy going to a tech conference 
								for the first time. If this is your first SpiceWorld we have your back!  Our goal is to be those faces in a sea 
								of strangers you can depend on for answers.  Let us help educate you about all that you can experience at 
								the conference.  Whether you came to hear a specific session, to meet with vendors, or to network with your 
								peers, we are here to help you make the most of SpiceWorld!<br /><br/>
								This website aggregates the official, semi-official, and unofficial parties, get-togethers, mixers, 
								hangouts, and shindigs, so that you have all the info you need to make the most of SpiceWorld right at 
								your fingertips!  Below you'll find a map of every location that is playing to a get-together - whether 
								official or unofficial - as well as many other useful places in the area.
